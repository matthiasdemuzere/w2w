	abstract = {Although observations and modeling studies show that heavy rainfall is increasing in many regions, how changes will manifest themselves on sub-daily timescales remains highly uncertain. Here, for the first time, we combine observational analysis and high-resolution modeling results to examine changes to extreme rainfall intensities in urbanized Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. We find that hourly intensities of extreme rainfall have increased by {\~{}}35{\%} over the last three decades, nearly 3 times more than in surrounding rural areas, with daily intensities showing much weaker increases. Our modeling results confirm that the urban heat island effect creates a more unstable atmosphere, increased vertical uplift and moisture convergence. This, combined with weak surface winds in the Tropics, causes intensification of rainfall extremes over the city, with reduced rainfall in the surrounding region.},

	abstract = {The generation of heat in buildings, and the way this heat is exchanged with the exterior, plays an important role in urban climate. To analyze the impact on urban climate of a change in the urban structure, it is necessary to build and use a model capable of accounting for all the urban heat fluxes. In this contribution, a new building energy model (BEM) is developed and implemented in an urban canopy parameterization (UCP) for mesoscale models. The new model accounts for: the diffusion of heat through walls, roofs, and floors; natural ventilation; the radiation exchanged between indoor surfaces; the generation of heat due to occupants and equipments; and the consumption of energy due to air conditioning systems. The behavior of BEM is compared to other models used in the thermal analysis of buildings (CBS-MASS, BLAST, and TARP) and with another box-building model. Eventually, a sensitivity analysis of different parameters, as well as a study of the impact of BEM on the UCP is carried out. The validations indicate that BEM provides good estimates of the physical behavior of buildings and it is a step towards a modeling tool that can be an important support to urban planners. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

@article{Martilli2002,
	abstract = {A scheme to represent the impact of urban buildings on airflow in mesoscale atmospheric models is presented. In the scheme, the buildings are not explicitly resolved, but their effects on the grid-averaged variables are parameterised. An urban quarter is characterised by a horizontal building size, a street canyon width and a building density as a function of height. The module computes the impact of the horizontal (roof and canyon floor) and vertical (walls) surfaces on the wind speed, temperature and turbulent kinetic energy. The computation of the shortwave and longwave radiation, needed to compute the temperature of the urban surfaces, takes into account the shadowing and radiation trapping effects induced by the urban canyons. The computation of the turbulent length scales in the TKE equation is also modified to take into account the presence of the buildings. The parameterisation is introduced into a mesoscale model and tested in a bidimensional case of a city over flat terrain. The new parameterisation is shown to be able to reproduce the most important features observed in urban areas better than the traditional approach which is based only on the modification of the roughness length, thereby retaining the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. The new surface exchange parameterisation is furthermore shown to have a strong impact on the dispersion characteristics of air pollutants in urban areas.},

@article{Zonato2020,
	abstract = {The definition of accurate input datasets, appropriately representing urban morphology characteristics, has been identified as a crucial point for improving the simulation of urban boundary layer (UBL) dynamics by means of mesoscale numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. However, the scarcity of suitable data to adequately describe urban morphology is in many cases a significant obstacle to overcome. For this purpose, the World Urban Database Portal Tool (WUDAPT) framework was developed in order to obtain a standard classification of urban morphology, even in the absence of ad-hoc data for any city. In the present work, a modified WUDAPT method to define urban morphology is proposed and compared with two state-of-the-art methods, i.e. the standard WUDAPT method and a urban morphology parameters obtained from LIDAR data. In particular, here morphological features of Local Climate Zones (LCZs), resulting from a 30-m resolution WUDAPT classification, are interpolated to NWP cells, providing averaged features of the urban morphology. In this way, the method produces a unique value of the different urban morphology parameters for each model cell. This technique is tested by means of simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at 500 m resolution for the city of Bologna (Italy), located in the Po Plain. Simulation output is compared with measurements from weather stations. Results show that simulations using the modified WUDAPT method reproduce better atmospheric dynamics with respect to those implementing the standard WUDAPT method, and are comparable with simulations using the urban morphology defined with LIDAR data, considered as reference. In particular, the most relevant improvements are found in areas where LCZs are more heterogeneous and where the boundary between rural and urban areas is not clearly defined. It follows that the use of this method improves the classic WUDAPT method for small and scattered cities with respect to large and clustered urban areas, and can be particularly useful for urban areas where detailed LIDAR data are not available.},

@article{Varentsov2020,
	abstract = {Urban canopy parameters (UCPs) are essential in order to accurately model the complex interplay between urban areas and their environment. This study compares three different approaches to define the UCPs for Moscow (Russia), using the COSMO numerical weather prediction and climate model coupled to TERRA{\_}URB urban parameterization. In addition to the default urban description based on the global datasets and hard-coded constants (1), we present a protocol to define the required UCPs based on Local Climate Zones (LCZs) (2) and further compare it with a reference UCP dataset, assembled from OpenStreetMap data, recent global land cover data and other satellite imagery (3). The test simulations are conducted for contrasting summer and winter conditions and are evaluated against a dense network of in-situ observations. For the summer period, advanced approaches (2) and (3) show almost similar performance and provide noticeable improvements with respect to default urban description (1). Additional improvements are obtained when using spatially varying urban thermal parameters instead of the hard-coded constants. The LCZ-based approach worsens model performance for winter however, due to the underestimation of the anthropogenic heat flux (AHF). These results confirm the potential of LCZs in providing internationally consistent urban data for weather and climate modelling applications, as well as supplementing more comprehensive approaches. Yet our results also underline the continued need to improve the description of built-up and impervious areas and the AHF in urban parameterizations.},

	abstract = {Cities are major drivers of environmental change at all scales and are especially at risk from the ensuing effects, which include poor air quality, flooding and heat waves. Typically, these issues are studied on a city-by-city basis owing to the spatial complexity of built landscapes, local topography and emission patterns. However, to ensure knowledge sharing and to inte- grate local-scale processes with regional and global scale modelling initiatives, there is a pressing need for a world-wide database on cities that is suited for environmental studies. In this paper we present a European database that has a particular focus on characterising urbanised landscapes. It has been derived using tools and techniques developed as part of the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) project, which has the goal of acquiring and disseminating climate-relevant information on cities worldwide. The Euro- pean map is the first major step toward creating a global database on cities that can be inte- grated with existing topographic and natural land-cover databases to support modelling initiatives.},

@article{Demuzere2020,
	abstract = {Although continental urban areas are relatively small, they are major drivers of environmental change at local, regional and global scales. Moreover, they are especially vulnerable to these changes owing to the concentration of population and their exposure to a range of hydro-meteorological hazards, emphasizing the need for spatially detailed information on urbanized landscapes. These data need to be consistent in content and scale and provide a holistic description of urban layouts to address different user needs. Here, we map the continental United States into Local Climate Zone (LCZ) types at a 100 m spatial resolution using expert and crowd-sourced information. There are 10 urban LCZ types, each associated with a set of relevant variables such that the map represents a valuable database of urban properties. These data are benchmarked against continental-wide existing and novel geographic databases on urban form. We anticipate the dataset provided here will be useful for researchers and practitioners to assess how the configuration, size, and shape of cities impact the important human and environmental outcomes.},

	abstract = {Since their introduction in 2012, Local Climate Zones (LCZs) emerged as a new standard for characterizing urban landscapes, providing a holistic classification approach that takes into account micro-scale land-cover and associated physical properties. In 2015, as part of the community-based World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) project, a protocol was developed that enables the mapping of cities into LCZs, using freely available data and software packages, yet performed on local computing facilities. The LCZ Generator described here further simplifies this process, providing an online platform that maps a city of interest into LCZs, solely expecting a valid training area file and some metadata as input. The web application (available at https://lcz-generator.rub.de ) integrates the state-of-the-art of LCZ mapping, and simultaneously provides an automated accuracy assessment, training data derivatives, and a novel approach to identify suspicious training areas. As this contribution explains all front- and back-end procedures, databases, and underlying datasets in detail, it serves as the primary ``User Guide'' for this web application. We anticipate this development will significantly ease the workflow of researchers and practitioners interested in using the LCZ framework for a variety of urban-induced human and environmental impacts. In addition, this development will ease the accessibility and dissemination of maps and their metadata.},

	abstract = {During the simulation of the urban heat island phenomenon, the accurate representation of urban geometry in numerical models is crucial. In this study, the local climate zone (LCZ) system was incorporated into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in order to facilitate proper land surface information for the model integrations. After the calculation of necessary input canopy parameters, based on local static datasets, simulations were performed to test the model's performance in predicting near-surface air temperature (Ta) and urban heat island intensity ($\Delta$T) under a heatwave period in July 2017. The modelled values were evaluated against the observations of the local urban climate monitoring system. The results suggest that WRF with a single-layer canopy scheme and the LCZ-based static database was able to capture the spatiotemporal variation of the aforementioned variables reasonably well. The daytime Ta was generally overestimated in each LCZ. At nights, slight overestimations (underestimations) occurred in LCZ 6, LCZ 9, and LCZ D (LCZ 2 and LCZ 5). The mean $\Delta$T was underestimated in the night-time; however, the daytime $\Delta$T was estimated accurately. The mean maxima (minima) of $\Delta$T were underestimated (overestimated) with around 1.5--2 $\,^{\circ}$C, particularly in LCZ 2 and LCZ 5. Some components of the surface energy budget were also computed to shed light on the inter-LCZ differences of Ta. It was concluded that the nocturnal ground heat flux was about five times higher in urban LCZs than in the rural LCZ D, which resulted in a reduced cooling potential over the urbanized areas.},

@article{Wong2019,
	abstract = {The evaluation of uWRF (WRF BEP/BEM) model over Hong Kong or the Pearl River Delta region has received less attention. One reason is the lack of a complete urban canopy parameters dataset for the building morphology in the PRD region. In recent years, the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) approach has provided an alternative estimation of the building morphology dimensions based on satelliteretrieved local climate zones (LCZs). However, several sources of uncertainty arise when implementing these data in uWRF. In this study, different methods of WUDAPT dataset implementation are carried out to isolate and quantify these sources. This study also revealed that compensation error could occur when all of the uncertainties are summed in the default W2W protocol. Nevertheless, WUDAPT remains a suitable alternative in regions where a NUDAPT type of dataset is not available, provided that building morphology for different LCZs is estimated based on local expertise with a subgrid-averaging approach. Comparison with surface stations over an urban area suggests that uWRF allows a much better simulation of wind speed than the traditional Noah Bulk urban scheme, indicating that the improvement from a multi-layer urban scheme is larger than a non-local PBL scheme over urban area.},

@article{Ribeiro2021,
	abstract = {This study evaluates the performance of urban schemes integrated in the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) using Local Climate Zones (LCZ) as land use classification. We applied two multi-layer urban schemes: 1) Building Effect Parameterization (BEP) and 2) Building Energy Model coupled with BEP (BEP + BEM), over the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (MAB) at 1km2 horizontal resolution for July 2016. These two simulations were compared with observations and a standard WRF simulation (BULK approach). Corine Land Cover 2012 provides background information for the entire simulation domain, while the LCZ covers MAB classifying the land cover into 10 classes according to urban morphology and thermal properties. BULK and multi-layer urban scheme experiments present a similar general error trend: overestimation of relative humidity and planetary boundary layer height and underestimation of temperature. Although BEP has the best correlation with observations, this is the scheme with the highest value of bias and RMSE for temperature and relative humidity, in particular during the night/morning. On the other hand, BEP + BEM performed with the minimum RMSE associated for temperature and relative humidity in the entire domain. BEP + BEM has shown to be more sensitive than the other schemes over locations where the land use in the model grid differs to the real one, which is a common consequent limitation of horizontal model resolution. This study also suggests that depending on the synoptic condition the scheme accuracy on determining PBLH might change considerably.},

@article{Bhati2018,
	abstract = {Urban heat island effect has been assessed using weather research and forecasting model (WRF v3.5) focusing on air temperature and surface skin temperature in the sub-tropical urban Indian megacity of Delhi. Impact of urbanization-related changes in land use/land cover (LULC) on model outputs has been analyzed. Four simulations have been carried out with different types of LULC data viz. (1) USGS, (2) MODIS, (3) user-modified USGS and (4) user-modified land use data coupled with urban canopy model (UCM) for incorporation of canopy features. Heat island intensities have been estimated based on these simulations and subsequently compared with those derived from in situ and satellite observations. There is a significant improvement in model performance with modification of LULC and inclusion of UCM. Overall, RMSEs for near surface temperature improved from 6.3 to 3.9 $\,^{\circ}$C and index of agreement for mean urban heat island intensities (UHI) improved from 0.4 to 0.7 with modified land use coupled with UCM. In general, model is able to capture the magnitude of UHI as well as high UHI zones well. A simple method of bias correction in model has been applied to improve model results for further application. The study highlights the importance of appropriate and updated the representation of land use--land cover and urban canopies for improving predictive capabilities of the mesoscale models. Urban heat island has been known to have effect on human thermal comfort. In the present study, Heat Index, a commonly used indicator of thermal comfort, is assessed spatially using WRF-UCM derived results. Urban areas were found to have higher Heat Index than non-urban areas by a difference of about 1.5--2 $\,^{\circ}$C. Further, it was found that urban canopy effect leads to rise in thermal discomfort by increasing Heat Index. There is an increase in Heat Index of about 2.0--2.5 $\,^{\circ}$C at dense built-up stations. Decrease in thermal comfort causes a significant impact on energy demand. Hence, analysis of urban heat island effect vis-a-vis thermal comfort provides useful information with regard to impact on human comfort and welfare.},

@article{Mallard2018,
	abstract = {Land-use (LU) representation plays a critical role in simulating air-surface interactions that affect meteorological conditions and regional climate. In the Noah LSM within the WRF Model, LU categories are used to set the radiative properties of the surface and to influence exchanges of heat, moisture, and momentum between the air and land surface. Previous literature examined the sensitivity of WRF simulations to LU using short-term meteorological modeling approaches. Here, the sensitivity to LU representation is studied using continental-scale dynamical downscaling, which typically uses longer temporal and larger spatial scales. Two LU datasets, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) dataset and the 2006 National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD), are utilized in 3-yr dynamically downscaled WRF simulations over a historical period. Precipitation and 2-m air temperature are evaluated against observation-based datasets for simulations covering the contiguous United States. The WRF-NLCD simulation tends to produce lower precipitation than the WRF-USGS run, with slightly warmer mean monthly temperatures. However, WRF-NLCD results in more notable increases in the frequency of hot days [i.e., days with temperature {\textgreater} 90$\,^{\circ}$F (32.2$\,^{\circ}$C)]. These changes are attributable to reductions in forest and agricultural area in the NLCD relative to USGS. There is also subtle but important sensitivity to the method of interpolating LU data to the WRF grid in the model preprocessing. In all cases, the sensitivity resulting from changes in the LU is smaller than model error. Although this sensitivity is small, it persists across spatial and temporal scales.},
